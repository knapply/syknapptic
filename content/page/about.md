Hi, I'm Brendan. I'm interested in bridging the gap between national security analysis and data science.

I'm currently finishing up a Master's degree in Nonproliferation and Terrorism Studies at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies (MIIS). During my time at MIIS, I have focussed on data-driven analysis of topics spanning counterterrorism, hybrid conflict, CBRN, and threat finance.

In the past, I worked as a security manager, combat medic, noncommissioned officer, linguist, and herder of cats.

# About this Blog

![](/img/logo_small.png)

This site is intended to showcase analysis, code, walkthroughs, and lessons-learned from data-centric projects.

The topics will address issues that are probably best described as open-source intelligence, along with inevitable depatures into various other areas and code-specific discussion.

## Motivation

After being asked if I had a blog with expanded explanations of projects I have discussed, I decided it was time to bite the bullet and start sharing.

I can't overstate how beneficial data science blogs, public repositories, and #Rstats community members have been for my own growth. With that in mind, I hope to provide a similar resource for anyone struggling. I'd like to offer the same sort of inspiration I felt when I first started exploring the work of others.

I also want to continue to grow as a programmer and analyst. As a self-taught coder who finally took the plunge into R in February 2017 (and whose work has been overwhelmingly individual) I'm looking forward to feedback, advice, and constructive criticism from those willing to offer it. 

# About Me

## Data Areas of Interest

I started my journey in data-centric analysis by taking a dive into Network Analysis, a topic that continues to deeply resonate with me. I was even very fortunate to have the opportunity to present a research project titled "Evaluating Institutional Coalescence with the Use of Exponential Random Graph Models" at the 1st North American Social Networks Conference in July 2017. 

Since that time, I have expanded to an array of others areas, including:

* Text Mining and Natural Language Processing
* Spatial Analysis
* Data Visualization and Communication
* Web Application Development

Much of my most recent work has caused me to start looking at deep learning.

## Current Work

I was fortunate enough to be hired as an analyst at MIIS's META Lab. To paraphrase a colleague, the META Lab is a "student-run and faculty-led data consulting firm". The position provides me the opportunity to teach analytical workshops to other graduate students and hold office hours for those taking quantitative analysis classes. I also get to help any staff or faculty seeking guidance with their projects. This has ranged from the structuring of financial flow data to brainstorming programmatic ballistic missile simulation. I also work as the Teaching Assistant for MIIS's Network Analysis course.

These opportunities have reignited an enthusiasm for teaching that I held as a noncommissioned officer. Much of my responsibility as an NCO included the training and mentoring of the next generation of enlisted professionals. This was often the most rewarding part of the job and I'm grateful to rediscover it.

I am also a research assistant at MIIS's Center for Nonproliferation Studies. There, I support senior researchers in WMD-specific projects. This has included a special emphasis on the processing and analysis of remote sensing imagery along with the mining of North Korean media.

## Other Research

My experience deployed to Afghanistan included a significant amount of time interacting with enemy combatants. I would actually argue that my exposure was greater than anyone else at during that period as a result of my location, role as a medic, and some previous Dari language training. This experience has informed much of my personal research in the operational and social organization of paramilitary groups. As a student at MIIS, I have dedicated a great deal of time dissecting the ecosystem in which these organizations exist, with a special emphasis on Salafi jihadist groups operating in Syria.
