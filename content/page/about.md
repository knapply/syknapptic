Hi, I'm Brendan. I'm interested in using data to develop evidence-based insights.

I primarily focus on conflict and security issues, which is work that I characterize as being wildly interdisciplinary. The result is that I'm constantly exploring theories and methods that developed in other fields.

In the past, I worked as a security manager, combat medic, noncommissioned officer, linguist, and herder of cats.

When I finally had a chance to return to academia, I developed a love for data analysis and programming. This was primarily fueled by a fascination with network analysis. 

Since then, I have focused on the fusion of computational methods with domain expertise in topics spanning hybrid conflict, insurgency, WMD, and threat finance.

Disciplines that I've used in my work include network analysis, spatial statistics, remote sensing, natural language processing, and machine learning. 

# About this Blog

![](http://res.cloudinary.com/syknapptic/image/upload/v1516468904/logo_rd5ifq.png)

My goal is to address the interests of two audiences that are oftentimes more distinct than I'd like: 

* those with an interest in modern data analysis (R enthusiasts in particular)
* those interested in open-source intelligence.

## Motivation

After being asked if I had a blog with expanded explanations of projects I have discussed, I decided it was time to bite the bullet and start sharing.

I can't overstate how beneficial data science blogs, public code repositories, and #Rstats community members have been for my own growth. With that in mind, I hope to provide a similar resource for anyone who might be struggling. Hopefully, I can offer a bit of the same inspiration I felt when I first started exploring the work of others.

# syknapptic?

If you haven't guessed, _syknapptic_ is derived from _synaptic_.
