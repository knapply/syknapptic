# About Me

I'm Brendan, a graduate student and analyst specializing in WMD, terrorism, and other security issues who discovered a passion for analytics and coding. In the past, I worked as a combat medic, Arabic linguist, and analyst and am proud to have developed a reputation for masterfully herding cats. I'm currently finishing up a Master's degree in Nonproliferation and Terrorism Studies at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies (MIIS).

I'm interested in bridging the gap between open source intelligence/security policy and modern, so-called Data Science. I initially began teaching myself the Python programming language in late 2016, but switched to R in early 2017 when a professional network analysis project required statistical libraries unavailable within the Python ecosystem. I presented that project (titled "Evaluating Institutional Coalescence with the Aid of Exponential Random Graph Models") at the 1st North American Social Networks Conference of the International Network of Social Network Analysis.

Since then, I have taken a deep dive into R across a broad array of topics that include: 

* Network Analysis
* Text Mining and Natural Language Processing
* Spatial Analysis
* Web Application Development
* Data Visualization and Communication

Much of my most recent work involves remote sensing imagery where I am starting to explore the applications of deep learning.

# Working with the MIIS META Lab

I was fortunate enough to be hired as an analyst at MIIS's META Lab, a homegrown data analytics center where I am currently a Lead Research Coordinator. To paraphrase a colleague, the META Lab is a "student-run consulting firm" bolstered by those MIIS professors teaching applied statistics courses for policy and econcomics. The position provides me the opportunity to teach analytical workshops to other graduate students as well as host office hours for those taking analytical classes, including quantitative, qualitative, geospatial, and network coursework. I also get to help any staff or faculty seeking guidance with their research, which has ranged from the structuring of financial flow data to programmatic ballistic missile simulation.

One of the most exciting aspects of my work with the META Lab has been my role as a Teaching Assistant for a Network Analysis course which has included writing code to transition the course from GUI platforms to R. My personal affinity for networks has made helping other students discover just how cool they are has been an incredibly rewarding experience.

These opportunities reignited an enthusiasm for teaching that I held as a noncomissioned officer in the U.S. Army. Much of my responsibility as an NCO included the training and mentoring of the next generation of enlisted professionals. This was often the most rewarding part of my military experience and I'm grateful to rediscover it.

# Working with MIIS's Center for Nonproliferation Studies

Additionally, I am a research assistant at MIIS's Center for Nonproliferation Studies. There, I support senior researchers in WMD-specific projects. This has included a special emphasis on the processing and analysis of remote sensing imagery, the mining of North Korean media, and exploration of potential avenues through which they can bolster their open-source intelligence research.

# Some of my Research

My experience in Afghanistan included a significant amount of time personally interacting with enemy combatants due to a combination of my role as a medic and previous Dari language training I had received. This experience has informed much of my personal research in the operational and social organization of paramilitary groups. As a student at MIIS, I have dedicated a great deal of time researchcing and dissecting the ecosystem of these organizations, with a special emphasis on Salafi jihadist groups operating in Syria. This experience has taught me a great deal about of the current state of affairs in the formal research of contemporary conflict and the how rigorous study of such a topic can be improved. I suspect this will be addressed in a series of blog posts down the road.

# About this Blog

I am interested in sharing the knowledge I have developed since beginning my journey in analytics and programming. After I started being asked if I had a blog with expanded explanations of some work I had shared with others, I decided it was time to start showcasing work in a centralized venue. With that in mind, I finally started this site.

This content will showcase some of the analyses I have been working on for personal projects as well as some for professional projects when possible. I will also be incorporating lessons I have learned throughout my journey while attempting to illuminate the traps potentially encountered by others trying to take the plunge. I also hope to share insights and motivation that are as awesome as so much of the inspirational work I have seen from others. 

The data sets will focus on issues either directly related (or tangentially relevant) to international security issues. As you might imagine, these data are not typically easy to find, access, or actually use, so I expect many of the posts to focus on data discovery and the process of transforming raw information into a structured format suitable for analysis. That said, I anticipate meandering departures into other topics.

# syknapptic?

If you haven't guessed, _syknapptic_ is simply a morphological derivation of _synaptic_, as in __relating to a synapse__, which includes my last name. The biology and psychology courses I took years ago left me fascinated with neuroscience. __They are the telephone lines of the nervous system that permit the transfer of information and provide an elegant analogy for connecting systems, communicating ideas, and bridging gaps between worlds and methodologies.__

# Other

In my personal life, I've made California's beautiful Monterey Peninsula my second home where my husband and I feed another passion that has developed in recent years: motorcycles.
