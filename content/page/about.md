Hi, I'm Brendan. I'm interested in developing the data-driven insights required to fully enable decision makers.

My primary focus has been national security policy, but considering the interdisciplinary nature of such a topic, I am constantly exploring other fields.

I'm currently finishing up a Master's degree in Nonproliferation and Terrorism Studies at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies (MIIS). During my time at MIIS, I have focused on the fusion of quantitative methods with rich domain knowledge in topics spanning hybrid conflict, terrorism, insurgency, WMD, and threat finance.

In the past, I worked as a security manager, combat medic, noncommissioned officer, linguist, and herder of cats.

# About this Blog

![](http://res.cloudinary.com/syknapptic/image/upload/v1516468904/logo_rd5ifq.png)

This site is intended to showcase analysis, code, walkthroughs, and lessons-learned from data-centric projects.

The topics will seek to address the interests of two audiences that are oftentimes more distinct than I'd like: those with an interest in data analysis (R enthusiasts in particular) and those interested in open-source intelligence. 

## Motivation

After being asked if I had a blog with expanded explanations of projects I have discussed, I decided it was time to bite the bullet and start sharing.

I can't overstate how beneficial data science blogs, public code repositories, and #Rstats community members have been for my own growth. With that in mind, I hope to provide a similar resource for anyone struggling. I'd love to offer the same sort of inspiration I felt when I first started exploring the work of others.

I also want to continue to grow as a programmer and analyst. As a self-taught coder who finally took the plunge into R in February 2017 (and whose work has been overwhelmingly individual) I'm looking forward to feedback, advice, and constructive criticism from those willing to offer it. 

# About Me

## Data Areas of Interest

I started my journey in data-centric analysis by taking a dive into Network Analysis, a topic that continues to deeply resonate with me. I was very fortunate to have the opportunity to present a research project titled "Evaluating Institutional Coalescence with the Use of Exponential Random Graph Models" at the 1st North American Social Networks Conference in July 2017. 

Since that time, I have expanded to an array of others areas, including:

* Text Mining and Natural Language Processing
* Spatial Analysis
* Data Visualization and Communication
* Application Development

## Recent Work

I am currently the Lead Analytic Coordinator of MIIS's META Lab. To paraphrase a colleague, the META Lab is a "student-run and faculty-led data consulting firm". The position provides me the opportunity to teach analytical workshops to other graduate students and hold office hours for those taking quantitative analysis classes. I also get to help any staff or faculty seeking guidance with their projects. This has ranged from the structuring of financial flow data, to extracting and formatting Ukrainian elections results, to brainstorming programmatic ballistic missile simulation. I also work as the Teaching Assistant for MIIS's Network Analysis course.

These opportunities have reignited an enthusiasm for teaching that I held as a noncommissioned officer. Much of my responsibility as an NCO included the training and mentoring of the next generation of enlisted professionals. This was often the most rewarding part of the job and I'm grateful to rediscover it.

I am also a research assistant at MIIS's Center for Nonproliferation Studies. There, I support senior researchers in WMD-specific projects. This has included an emphasis on the processing and analysis of remote sensing imagery along with the mining of North Korean media.

## Other Research

My experience deployed to Afghanistan included a significant amount of time interacting with enemy combatants. I would actually argue that my exposure was greater than anyone else during that period as a result of my location, role as a medic, and previous Dari language training. This experience has informed much of my personal research in the operational and social organization of paramilitary groups. As a student at MIIS, I have dedicated a great deal of time dissecting the ecosystem in which these organizations exist, with a special emphasis on Salafi jihadist groups operating in Syria.
