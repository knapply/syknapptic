Hi, I'm Brendan. I'm interested in developing the data-driven insights required to fully enable decision makers.

Topically, my primarily focus is national security issues, but considering the wildly interdisciplinary nature of such work, I am constantly exploring other fields.

In the past, I worked as a security manager, combat medic, noncommissioned officer, linguist, and herder of cats. When I finally returned to formal academia, I developed a love for data analysis and programming. Since then, I have focused on the fusion of computational and quantitative methods with rich domain knowledge in topics spanning hybrid conflict, terrorism, insurgency, WMD, and threat finance.

# About this Blog

![](http://res.cloudinary.com/syknapptic/image/upload/v1516468904/logo_rd5ifq.png)

This site is intended to showcase analysis, code, walkthroughs, and lessons-learned from data-centric projects.

The topics will seek to address the interests of two audiences that are oftentimes more distinct than I'd like: those with an interest in data analysis (R enthusiasts in particular) and those interested in open-source intelligence. 

## Motivation

After being asked if I had a blog with expanded explanations of projects I have discussed, I decided it was time to bite the bullet and start sharing.

I can't overstate how beneficial data science blogs, public code repositories, and #Rstats community members have been for my own growth. With that in mind, I hope to provide a similar resource for anyone who might be struggling. Hopefully, I can offer a bit of the same inspiration I felt when I first started exploring the work of others.

# syknapptic?

If you haven't guessed, _syknapptic_ is derived from _synaptic_.
