# About this Blog

I am interested in sharing the knowledge I have developed since beginning my journey in analytics and programming. After I started being asked if I had a blog with expanded explanations of some work I had shared with others, I decided it was time to start showcasing work in a centralized venue. With that in mind, I finally started this site.

This content will showcase some of the analyses I have been working on for personal projects as well as some for professional projects when possible. I will also be incorporating lessons I have learned throughout my journey while attempting to illuminate the traps potentially encountered by others trying to take the plunge. I also hope to share insights and motivation that are as awesome as so much of the inspirational work I have seen from others. 

The data sets will focus on issues either directly related (or tangentially relevant) to international security issues. As you might imagine, these data are not typically easy to find, access, or actually use, so I expect many of the posts to focus on data discovery and the process of transforming raw information into a structured format suitable for analysis. That said, I anticipate meandering departures into other topics.

# About Me

I'm Brendan, a graduate student and analyst specializing in WMD, terrorism, and other security issues who discovered a passion for analytics and coding. In the past, I worked as a combat medic, Arabic linguist, and master of cat-herding. I'm currently finishing up a Master's degree in Nonproliferation and Terrorism Studies at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies (MIIS).

I'm interested in bridging the gap between security analysis and modern data analytics. I initially began teaching myself the Python programming language in late 2016, but switched to R in early 2017 when a professional network analysis project with one of my professors required statistical libraries unavailable within the Python ecosystem. I presented that project (titled "Evaluating Institutional Coalescence with the Aid of Exponential Random Graph Models") at the 1st North American Social Networks Conference of the International Network of Social Network Analysis.

Since then, I have taken a deep dive into R across a broad array of topics that include: 

* Network Analysis
* Text Mining and Natural Language Processing
* Spatial Analysis
* Web Application Development
* Data Visualization and Communication

Much of my most recent work involves remote sensing imagery where I am starting to explore the applications of deep learning.

# Working with the MIIS META Lab

I was fortunate enough to be hired as an analyst at MIIS's META Lab, a homegrown data analytics center where I am currently a Lead Research Coordinator. To paraphrase a colleague, the META Lab is a "student-run consulting firm" bolstered by MIIS professors who specialize in applied quantitative topics. The position provides me the opportunity to teach analytical workshops to other graduate students and host office hours for those taking quantitative analysis classes. I also get to help any staff or faculty seeking guidance with their research, which has ranged from the structuring of financial flow data to programmatic ballistic missile simulation. I also work as the Teaching Assistant for MIIS's network analysis course.

These opportunities have reignited an enthusiasm for teaching that I held as a noncommissioned officer. Much of my responsibility as an NCO included the training and mentoring of the next generation of enlisted professionals. This was often the most rewarding part of my military experience and I'm grateful to rediscover it.

# Working with MIIS's Center for Nonproliferation Studies

Additionally, I am a research assistant at MIIS's Center for Nonproliferation Studies. There, I support senior researchers in WMD-specific projects. This has included a special emphasis on the processing and analysis of remote sensing imagery, the mining of North Korean media, and exploration of potential avenues to augment their research.

# Some of my Research

My experience in Afghanistan included a significant amount of time personally interacting with enemy combatants, resulting from a combination of my role as a medic and previous Dari language training I had received. This experience has informed much of my personal research in the operational and social organization of paramilitary groups. As a student at MIIS, I have dedicated a great deal of time dissecting the ecosystem in which these organizations exist, with a special emphasis on Salafi jihadist groups operating in Syria.

# syknapptic?

If you haven't guessed, _syknapptic_ is simply a morphological derivation of _synaptic_, as in __relating to a synapse__, which includes my last name. __They are the telephone lines of the nervous system that permit the transfer of information and provide an elegant analogy for connecting systems, communicating ideas, and bridging gaps between worlds and methodologies.__

# Other

In my personal life, I've made California's Monterey Peninsula my second home where my husband and I feed another passion that has developed in recent years: motorcycles.
