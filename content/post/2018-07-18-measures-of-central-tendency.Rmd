Rather than letting R and Python do all the work for us (i.e. cheating, as a no-nonsense former professor would call it), the best way to understand what any calculation actually means is to walk through the steps. I doubt I'm the only one who wishes they started to code this way.

With that in mind, here's a collection of "from scratch" functions implemented in both R and Python that provide _minimal_ hand-holding.

This should (hopefully) also serve as a handy reference for useRs and Pythonistas curious about the greenness of the grass on the other side. My goal here is to lay a foundation before writing similar walkthroughs covering more complicated workflows, statistical models, and machine learning.

_A quick note:_

In R, experience has taught me to use `[[` instead of `[` _whenever it's possible to obtain the desired results with `[[`_. With that in mind, I try to use `[[` in the R examples (unless swapping between R and Python messed me up).

Clearly, [useRs have an assortment of opinions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1169456/the-difference-between-and-notations-for-accessing-the-elements-of-a-lis) on how to use `[[` and `[`, but this is probably as simple an explanation as you can get:

```{r, echo=FALSE}

```

All that said, let's get to it.

# Toy Values

We'll use the same values for `x` throughout:

### Python `list`

```{python}
x = [25.88, 37.05, 38.46, 76.78, 76.78, 71.97, 33.99, 73.29, 2.53, 76.78, 
     74.94, 73.4, 64.87, 57.8, 42.82, 76.78, 7.95, 60.26, 2.14, 59.51]
```

### R `vector`

```{r}
x <- c(25.88, 37.05, 38.46, 76.78, 76.78, 71.97, 33.99, 73.29, 2.53, 76.78,
       74.94, 73.4, 64.87, 57.8, 42.82, 76.78, 7.95, 60.26, 2.14, 59.51)
```


The first thing we need to do is define some helper functions. In order to calculate mean, median, and mode, we will also need to find the:

* length of the sequence: `my_length()`
* unique values in a sequence: `my_unique()`
* maximum value in a sequence: `my_max()`
    + `my_min()` is also included for reference
* sum of values in a sequence: `my_sum()`

# Length

### Python's `len()`

```{python}
def my_length(x):          # `def`ine the function, which takes the parameter `x`
  length = 0               # declare a `length` variable that initially equals `0`
  
  for item in x:           # `for` each `item` in `x`
    length += 1            # add `1` to `length` (same as `length = length + 1`)
  
  return length            # finally, `return` the calculated `length`
```

```{python}
print(my_length(x))

print(len(x) == my_length(x)) # does our custom function give the same result as Python's built-in?
```

### R's `length()`

```{r}
my_length <- function(x) {  # declare the `function`, which takes the parameter `x`
  length <- 0L              # declare a `length` variable that initially equals `0L`...
                            # ... in R, numbers are treated as `double`s unless we...
                            # ... specifiy them to be `integer`s. `0L` is the same as...
                            # ... `as.integer(0)`.
                            # `length` doesn't NEED to be an `integer`, but if we're ... 
                            # ... careful about types early, we'll save headaches later.

  for(item in x) {          # `for` each `item` in `x`
    length <- length + 1L   # add `1L` to length
  }
  
  length                    # finally, return the calculated `length`...
                            # we can use `return(length)`, but `return` in R is best used ...
                            # ... only when you're breaking from a function early
}
```

```{r}
my_length(x)
                       # does our custom function give the same result as R's built-in?
length(x) == my_length(x)
```

# Unique Values

### Python's `set()`

```{python}
def my_unique(x):               # `def`ine the function, which takes the parameter `x`
  unique_x = []                 # declare an empty `list` named `unique_x`
  
  for item in x:                # for each `item` in `x`
    if item not in unique_x:    # if the `item` is not in `unique_x`
      unique_x.append(item)     # `append` the `item` to `unique_x`
      
  return unique_x               # finally, `return` the list of `unique_x`'s values
```

```{python}
print(my_unique(x))
```

In order to test Python's `my_unique()`, we need to use a loop as Python `set()`s are not ordered.

Here, we'll use a "list-comprehension".

In Python, we _can_ do this...

```{python}
matches = []
for item in my_unique(x):
  matches.append(item in set(x))
  
print(all(matches))
```

... but it's considered more "Pythonic" to use a list-comprehension in this scenario...

```{python}
matches = [item in set(x) for item in my_unique(x)]
print(all(matches))
```

... which we can wrap up in a one-liner...

```{python}
print(all([item in set(x) for item in my_unique(x)]))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("http://res.cloudinary.com/syknapptic/image/upload/v1531937508/2e99mn_s5lxip.jpg")
```

Jokes aside, list-comprehensions are generally faster. Considering "pure" Python isn't vectorized like R, they are quite handy.

### R's `unique()`

```{r}
my_unique <- function(x) {           # declare the `function`, which takes the parameter `x`
  unique_x <- vector(mode = mode(x)) # declare an empty `vector` with the same `mode` as `x`...
                                     # ... in R, it's a good habit to enforce data types ...
                                     # ... to maximize performance. In a perfect world, we
                                     # ... would also want to set `unique_x`'s `length`.
  for(item in x) {
    if(!item %in% unique_x) {       # in R, `%in%` is a vectorized match that returns a `logical` vector
      unique_x <- c(unique_x, item)
    }
  }
  
  unique_x
}
```

```{r}
my_unique(x)
                         # does our custom function give the same result as R's built-in?
all(unique(x) == my_unique(x))
```

# Max

### Python's `max()`

```{python}
def my_max(x):
  max = x[0]

  for item in x:
    if item > max:
      max = item
  
  return max
```

```{python}
print(my_max(x))
                 # does our custom function give the same result as Pythons's built-in?
print(max(x) == my_max(x))
```

### R's `max()`

```{r}
my_max <- function(x) {
  max <- x[[1]]
  
  for(item in x) {
    if(item > max) {
      max <- item
    }
  }
  max
}
```

```{r}
my_max(x)
                 # does our custom function give the same result as R's built-in?
max(x) == my_max(x)
```

# Min

### Python's `min()`

```{python}
def my_min(x):
  min = x[0]        # Python indexing starts at `0`, so `min` starts as the first item in `x`
  
  for item in x:
    if item < min:
      min = item
  
  return min
```

```{python}
print(my_min(x))
                 # does our custom function give the same result as Python's built-in?
print(min(x) == my_min(x))
```

### R's `min()`

```{r}
my_min <- function(x) {
  min <- x[[1]]     # R indexing starts at `1`, so `min` starts as the first item in `x`
  
  for(item in x) {
    if(item < min) {
      min <- item
    }
  }
  min
}
```

```{r}
my_min(x)
                 # does our custom function give the same result as Python's built-in?
min(x) == my_min(x)
```

# Sum

### Python's `sum()`

```{python}
def my_sum(x):     # `def`ine the function, which takes the parameter `x`
  sum = 0          # declare a `sum` variable that initially equals `0`
  for item in x:   # `for` each `item` in `x`
    sum += item    # add the `item`'s value to `sum`
  
  return sum       # finally, return the calculated `sum`
```

```{python}
print(my_sum(x))
                 # does our custom function give the same result as Python's built-in?
print(sum(x) == my_sum(x))
```

### R's `sum()`

```{r}
my_sum <- function(x) { # declare the `function`, which takes the parameter `x`
  sum <- 0              # declare a `sum` variable that initially equals `0`...
  
  for(item in x) {      # `for` each `item` in x
    sum <- sum + item   # add the `item` to `sum`
  }
  
  sum                   # finally, call `sum` to return its value
}
```

```{r}
sum(x)
                 # does our custom function give the same result as R's built-in?
sum(x) == my_sum(x)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("http://res.cloudinary.com/syknapptic/image/upload/v1531921800/cent-tend.png")
```

# Mean

### Python's `statistics.mean()`

```{python}
def my_mean(x):
  return float(my_sum(x) / my_length(x))
```

```{python}
print(my_mean(x))

import statistics          # in Python, `mean()` is kept in the `statistics` module, which ...
                           # ... we `import` like this
                            
                           # does our custom function give the same result as 's built-in?
print(statistics.mean(x) == my_mean(x))
```

### R's `mean()`

```{r}
my_mean <- function(x) {
  my_sum(x) / my_length(x)
}
```

```{r}
my_mean(x)

mean(x) == my_mean(x)
```


# Mode

### Python's `statistics.mode()`

```{python}
def my_mode(x):
  unique_x = my_unique(x)
  occurrences = {}         # create and empty `dict()` to which we will be adding items
  
  for item in unique_x:
    count = my_length([value for value in x if value == item]) # count up the occurrences of each `item`
    occurrences.update({item: count})    # add the count to the the `occurrences` `dict()`
  
  keys = list(occurrences.keys())     # `dict()`s are unordered, so we make a list of `keys`...
  values = list(occurrences.values()) # ... and a list of `values`
  
  return keys[values.index(my_max(values))]  # get the index of the max value and select that key
```

```{python}
print(my_mode(x))

import statistics
print(statistics.mode(x) == my_mode(x))
```


### R's mode

```{r}
my_mode <- function(x) {
  unique_x <- my_unique(x)
  occurences <- vector(mode = mode(unique_x), length = length(unique_x))

  for(item in unique_x) {
    count <- c(item = my_length(x[x == item])) # because we're dealing with vectors in R we can... 
                                               # ... boolean mask with `[]` instead  of using a loop
    names(count) <- item                       # we turn `count` into a named `vector`...
                                               # but this coerces the `names` to `character`
    occurences <- c(occurences, count)
  }
  as.numeric(names(occurences[occurences == my_max(occurences)]))  # convert the `names` back to `numeric`
}
```

```{r}
my_mode(x) # R doesn't have a built-in function for a statistical mode
```

# Median

For `median()`, we need to be able to sort the list. We're just going to use built-in functions, but you can see how a bubble sort is performed [here](https://syknapptic.netlify.com/2018/07/bubble-sort/).

### Python

```{python}
def my_median(x):
  sorted_x = sorted(x)
  length_x = my_length(x)
  middle_index = (length_x - 1) // 2  # `//` is Python's operator for integer division
                                      # `%` is Python's operator for remainder
  if length_x % 2:                    # if `x`'s length is an odd value
    median = sorted_x[middle_index]
  if not length_x % 2:                # if `x`'s length is an even value
    median = my_mean([sorted_x[middle_index], sorted_x[middle_index + 1]])

  return median
```

```{python}
print(my_median(x))

import statistics
print(statistics.median(x) == my_median(x))
```

### R

```{r}
my_median <- function(x) {
  sorted_x <- sort(x)
  length_x <- my_length(x)
  middle_index <- length_x %/% 2 # `%/%` is R's operator for integer division
  
  if(length_x %% 2) {            # `%%` is R's operator for remainder
    median = sorted_x[[middle_index]]
  }
  if(!length_x %% 2) {
    median = my_mean(c(sorted_x[[middle_index]], sorted_x[[middle_index + 1]]))
  }

  median
}
```

```{r}
my_median(x)

median(x) == my_median(x)
```
