      <description>I recently had the opportunity to teach some tidyverse code to colleagues and classmates in a series of workshops. Some had already dabbled in R or other languages, but it was the first time that the majority of participants had written a single line of code.
In preparation for this workshop series, I found a lot of inspiration in Michael Levy’s presentation on teaching R, which itself echoes principles preached by other R advocates.</description>

      <description>----The Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone, or GDELT, is “a realtime network diagram and database of global human society for open research”.
