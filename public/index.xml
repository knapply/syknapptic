      <description>I recently had the opportunity to teach some tidyverse code to colleagues and classmates in a series of workshops. Some had already dabbled in R or other languages, but it was the first time that the majority of participants had written a single line of code.
In preparation for this workshop series, I found a lot of inspiration in Michael Levy’s presentation on teaching R, which itself echoes principles preached by other R advocates.</description>

      <description>----The Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone, or GDELT, is “a realtime network diagram and database of global human society for open research”. 
The potential for a firehose stream of global data has tantalizing possibilities for research, but concrete examples of work beyond simple evaluations of the database’s capabilities are notably absent…

      <description>body .main-container { max-width: 700px; }  Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Brendan. I&amp;rsquo;m interested in developing the data-driven insights required to fully enable decision makers.
Topically, I primarily focus on national security policy, but considering the interdisciplinary nature of such a topic, I am constantly exploring other fields.
In the past, I worked as a security manager, combat medic, noncommissioned officer, linguist, and herder of cats. When I finally returned to formal academia, I developed a love for data analysis and programming.</description>
