      <description>body .main-container { max-width: 700px; }  Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Brendan. I&amp;rsquo;m interested in using data to develop evidence-based insights.
I primarily focus on conflict and security issues, which is work that I characterize as being wildly interdisciplinary. The result is that I&amp;rsquo;m constantly exploring theories and methods that developed in other fields.
In the past, I worked as a security manager, combat medic, noncommissioned officer, linguist, and herder of cats.</description>
