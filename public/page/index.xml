      <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Brendan. I&amp;rsquo;m interested in developing the data-driven insights required to fully enable decision makers.
My primary focus has been national security policy, but considering the interdisciplinary nature of such a topic, I am constantly exploring other fields.
I&amp;rsquo;m currently finishing up a Master&amp;rsquo;s degree in Nonproliferation and Terrorism Studies at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies (MIIS). During my time at MIIS, I have focused on the fusion of quantitative methods with subject matter expertise in topics spanning hybrid conflict, terrorism, insurgency, CBRN, and threat finance.</description>
