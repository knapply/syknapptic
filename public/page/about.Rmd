I'm Brendan Knapp, a combat medic turned Arabic linguist turned data and security analyst that discovered a passion for analytics and coding. I'm currently finishing up a Master's degree in Nonproliferation and Terrorism Studies at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies (MIIS).

I'm interested in bridging the gap between national security analysis and the modern "Data Science" workflows more commonly seen in other fields. I initially began teaching myself the Python programming language in late 2016, but switched to R in February 2017 when a professional network analysis project required tools and techniques unavailable within the Python ecosystem, specifically Exponential Random Graph Models.

Since then, I have taken a deep dive into R in a broad set of topics spanning * Network Analysis * Text Mining and Natural Language Processing - Geospatial Analysis - Application Development - Data Visualization and Communication

Much of my most recent work involves the analysis of remote sensing imagery.

My interest in data began with the desire to deliver the rigorous, data-driven, and reproducible work I was seeing in other fields to the domains of security policy and intelligence. As I have grown as an analyst it has expanded to work in other domains of public policy.

Along the way, I was fortunate enough to be hired as an analyst at the META Lab (MIIS's homegrown data analytics center) and asked to be a Teaching Assistant for a Network Analysis course, including writing code to transition the course from GUI platforms to R. These opportunities reignited an enthusiasm for teaching that I held as a medic (and later linguist and analyst) in the U.S. Army, where much of my responsibility as a noncommissioned officer included training and mentoring the next generation of enlisted professionals. This was often the most rewarding part of my military experience.

Along those lines, I am interested in sharing the knowledge I have developed since beginning my journey in analytics and programming. After I started being asked if I had a blog further explaining some of the work I had shared with colleagues and online, I decided it was time to start publishing work in a centralized venue, namely this website.

This blog will showcase some of the analyses I have been working on for personal projects as well as those for professional projects when possible. I will also be incorporating lessons I have learned through my journey with emphasis on illuminating the traps encountered by self-taught analysts. The data sets will focus on issues relevant to national security issues when they are publically available, but I intend for them not to be completely limited to those topics.
