      <description>Should I learn R or Python? Despite the ninjillion articles and arguments dedicated to this debate, there isn’t a good, one-size-fits-all answer. But we have {reticulate}, so who cares! We can use both!
I started coding with Python. The choice seemed obvious at first. It’s a general programming language, so I wouldn’t be limited to only playing with data. Before grad school, I had never even heard of R so spending the time it would take to become truly functional seemed crazy, so I went for Python instead.</description>
